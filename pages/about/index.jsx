                Hi! My name is Thierno Barry, I am a full stack website
                developer based in Belgium.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a MERN stack web developer, I specialize in building dynamic,
                modern web applications using MongoDB, Express, React,Next Js
                and ,Node.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currently learning DevOps and System Admin (Shell Script,
                Github Actions, Gitlab, docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Vagrant,
                Ansible, Terraform, SonarQube, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS, Azure)
              </p>
              <p>
                With a strong foundation in JavaScript, I am skilled at
                developing both the front-end and back-end of web applications,
                making me a valuable asset in the development process from start
                to finish.
              </p>
              <p>
                My experience with the MERN stack allows me to create fast,
                responsive, and scalable applications that deliver a seamless
                user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time, I love to explore new technology and stay up
                to date on the latest industry trends. I am always looking for
                new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
              </p>
