How to Check disk Utilization.

```jsx
var=$(command-name-here)

var=command-name-here

AWK and Cut command basics

Read a file content

Grep command
```

Read a file content by opening it

```js
using vi / vim / nano editors .
```

Read a file content without opening it

```jsx
using cat, less, more
```

Read a file content with conditions
```jsx
using more, tail, grep, awk, sed
```

Read a file content with conditions...

**More command example**:

```jsx
more -n filename.txt //Displays text upto specified line
```

**Read +n filename.txt**

```jsx
The text is displayed from the specified line
```

**head command example**:

```js
head filename //By default head command reads top 10 lines from a file
```

```jsx
head -n filename //This option displays the top n number of lines of the document
```

**tail command example**:

```jsx
tail filename //By default tail command reads last 10 lines from a file
```

```jsx
tail -n filename //This option displays the last n number of lines of lines of the document
```

### awk command

The awk command is a powerful method for processing or analyzing text or data files, which are organized by lines (rows or records) and columns(fileds).

We can use awk as a linux command and alson as a scripting language like bash shell scripting.

Simple awk command syntax:

```jsx
awk [options] '[selection_criteria] {action}' input-file

cat input-file | awk [options]'[selection_criteria] {action}' input-file

Awk //Can take the following options:

    -F fs  //To specific a field separator: (Default separator is tab and space)

    -f file  //To specific a file that contains awk script.

    -v var=value  //To declare a variable.

Selection criteria: pattern/condition

Action: It is a logic to perform action on each row/record
```

**example 1** :

```js
df -h

df -h |awk '{print $5}'

df -h |grep /dev/sda3

df -h |grep /dev/sda3 |awk '{print $5}'

df -h |grep /dev/sda3 |awk '{print $5}' |cut -d '%' -f1
```


**example 2** :

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "Check disk usage in Linux system"
disk_size=`df -h|grep "/dev/sda3"|awk '{print $5}'|cut -d '%' -f 1`
echo "$disk_size% of disk is failled"
if [$disk_size -gt 80]
then
    echo "disk is utilized more than 80%, expand disk or delete files soon"
else
    echo "enough disk is available"
if
```

### du command

The du command is a standard Linux/Unix command that allows a user to get disk usage information quickly.

Flags:

```jsx
-h //The -h flag prints size outputs ,in a human-readable format.

-a //It lists the sizes of all files and directories in the given file path.
```

Usage:

```js
du -ah /tmp  //It list the size of all files and directory in the path /tmp in human readable format.
```

### sort command

SORT command is used to a file, arranging the records in a particular order.

Flags:

```jsx
sort -n  //Sort the file the in numerical order(less to more)

sort -r  //Prints the output in reverse order

sort -h  //--human-numeric-sort (compare human readable numbers)

sort -hr //Combined together it compares according to the string numerical value and reverses the result of comparison.
```

Command-line arguments are parameters that are passed to a script while executing them in the bash shell. They are also known as positional parameters in linux.

Let's say I am running the running the script as:

```jsx
./commandlinearguments.sh 
```

```jsx
How to Access arguments? |                 Description
-------------------------|---------------------------------
$0                       |  Script Name
------------------------------------------------------------
$1                       |  First Parameter of the script
------------------------------------------------------------
$@                       |  Complete list of argument
------------------------------------------------------------
$#                       |  Total number of parameters
------------------------------------------------------------
$$                       |  Process id of the script
------------------------------------------------------------
$?                       |  Exit code for the script
```

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "This program get first 10 biggest file in the file system passed via positional argument"

path="$1"

echo $path

du -ah $path | sort -hr | head -n 5 > /tmp/filesize.txt

echo "This is the list of big files in the file system $path"

cat /tmp/filesize.txt
```

### find command

It can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions.

Usage:

```jsx
find . file_name //file the file with name File_name in the current working directory.
```
We can specify any other location also.

### mtime command

Modified timestamp (mtime) indicates the last time the contents of a file were modified. For example, if new contents were added, deleted, or replace in d file the modified timestamp is changed.

```jsx
+n //For greater then n, -n for less than n, n for exactly n.
```

```jsx
-mtime +30  //Get the files greater than 30 days.
```

### Demo Time

```jsx
find . -mtime +30 -delete**

touch -a -m -t 201512180130.09 fileName.ext

-a = accessed -m = modified -t = timestamp - use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] time format
```

**example**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "This script delete files which are older than 30 days "
path="$1"
echo $path
find $path -mtime +30 -delete
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]];
then
   echo "Files are successfully deleted "
else
   echo "delete was having some issue"
fi
```
