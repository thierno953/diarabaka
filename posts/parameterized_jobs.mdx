Using build parameters, we can pass any data we want: git branch name, secret credentials, hostnames and ports, and so on.

Any Jenkins job or pipeline can be parameterized. All we need to do is check the box on the General settings tab, **this project is parameterized**:

### Parameterized Jobs Continued...

**Type:** The data type for the parameter (string, boolean, etc.)

**Name:** The name identifying the parameter.

**Default value:** An optional value that will be used when a user doesn't specify one.

**Description:** Optional text that describes how the parameter is used.

**A single Jenkins job or pipeline:** Can have multiple parameters. The only restriction is that the parameter name must be unique.

### Types of Parameters:

Jenkins supports several parameter types. Bellow is a list of the most common ones, but keep in mind that different plugins may add new parameter types:

**String:** Any combination of characters and numbers.

**Choice:** A pre-defined set of strings from which a user can pick a value.

**Credentials:** A pre-defined Jenkins credential.

**File:** The full path to a file on the filesystem.

**Multi-line String:** Same as String, but allows newline characters.

**Password:** Similar to the Credentials type, but allows us to pass a plain text parameter specific to the job or pipeline.

**Run:** An absolute URL to a single run of another job.
