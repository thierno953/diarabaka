**Prerequisites**:

```jsx
Wget

How to check file exists or not using -e
```

**Wget** is non-interactive, meaning that can work in the background, while the user is not logget on, which allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting "wget" finish the work. By constrast, most web browsers require constant user interaction, which make transferring a lot of data difficult.

### Installing wget

```jsx
sudo yum install wget -y

sudo apt-get install wget -y
```

**Wget Syntax**

```jsx
rpm -qa | grep wget
```

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo  Download the prometheus binaries"
if [ -e /home/vagrant/prometheus-2.43.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz ];
then
      echo "file is already existing so no need to download "
      tar -zxvf /home/vagrant/prometheus-2.43.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
else
      echo "binary does not exists in system first we need to download it"
      wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.43.1/prometheus-2.43.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
      tar -zxvf /home/vagrant/prometheus-2.43.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
      echo "file has been extracted, you can start prometheus"
fi
```
