**Curl flags:**

```jsx
-s //Silent request, it will not show progress bar.

-w //It will desplay the information on terminal.

("%{http_code}"); //To get the http code and for success its 200.
```

**example:**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash

URL="https://github.com/thierno953/Docker"
#echo "%{http_code}"
response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" $URL)

http1_code=$(tail -n1 <<< "$response")  // get the last line
content=$(sed '$ d' <<< "$response")   // get all but the last line which contains the status code

echo "$http1_code"
if [ $http1_code  == 200  ];
then
            echo "Request is working fine"
    else
            echo "send slack message that request is denied"
fi
#echo "$content"
```
