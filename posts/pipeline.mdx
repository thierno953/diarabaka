We can use a set of plugins that help in the implementation of certain processes as a continuous delivery pipeline. Where pipelines are defined using code by using language to define the processes that would run in the pipeline.

To implement pipeline as code, a Jenkinsfile needs to be present at the project's root repository.

Jenkinsfile supports two different syntax:

> Declarative
>
> Scripted

Declarative pipeline was a recent release and provides better syntax support over the Scripted pipelines.

### Why should you use Jenkins pipeline?

Pipeline can be run in a loop.

It supports larger projects that may involve a high CPU job, provided the Jenkins infrastructure is scalable enough to support it.

Since Jenkins is written in code, any number of users can use it as a template, modify it and run customized tests and processes.

Multiple jobs can be run in parallel.

Jenkins Pipeline is robust. Pipeline can automatically be resumed from it might have stopped for any reason.

### Understanding the pipeline

**Pipeline:** A user-defined block, which contains all the processes such as build, test, deploy, etc. All the stage and steps are defined in this block.

**Node:** The node is machine on which Jenkins runs. A node block is used in scripted pipeline syntax.

**Stage:** This block contains a series of steps in a pipeline. i.e., build, test, deploy processes on a stage.

### Multiple Stages in Jenkins pipeline

```jsx
pipeline {
   agent any

   stages {
      stage('build') {
         steps {
            echo 'Hello build stage'
         }
      }
      stage('test') {
         steps {
            echo 'Hello test stage'
         }
      }
      stage('deploy') {
         steps {
            echo 'Hello deploy stage'
         }
      }
   }
}
```
