Grafana provides various dashboards, charts, graphs, alerts for the particular data source.

Grafana allows us to query, visualize, explore metrics and set alerts for the data source which can be system, server, nodes, cluster, etc...

We can also create our own dynamic dashboard for visualization and monitoring.

We can save the dashboard and can even share with our team members which is one of the main advantage of Grafana.

**Download the Grafana GPG key with wget, then pipe the output to apt-key. This will add the key to your APT installation's list of trusted keys, which will allow you to download and verify the GPG-signed Grafana package:**

```bash
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

**Next, add the Grafana repository to your APT sources:**

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
```

**Refresh your APT cache to update your package lists:**

```bash
sudo apt update
```

**You can now proceed with the installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install grafana
```

**Once Grafana is installed, use systemctl to start the Grafana server:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start grafana
```

**Next, verify that Grafana is running by checking the service's status:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status grafana
```

**Now finally enable the Grafana service which will automatically start the Grafana on boot.**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable grafana
```
