For **example**, if there are 10 values in the list, then loop will execute ten times and each value will be stored in varname.

Usage:

```jsx
for table in 1 2 3 4
do
  echo "value in $table" 
done
```

```js
find . -type d.  //Check for directory type in current working directory(.)
```

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
for folder in $(find -type d);
do
  echo "the folder is $folder"
  if [ -d test ]
  then
      echo "this folder exists"
      echo "removing the folder"
      rm -rf test
  else
      echo "test folder does not exists"
  fi
done
```
