**Prerequisite:**

The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression(grep stands for global search for regular expression and print out).

**Syntax:**

```jsx
grep [options] pattern [files]
```

**devopsclass.txt**

```jsx
id,  firstname, lastname, email,             profession

1,   John,      Doe,      john@gmail.com,    frontend
2,   Paul,      Dupont,   paul@gmail.com,    backend
3,   Pierre,    Duran,    pierre@gmail.com,  devOps
```

```jsx
grep -i John devopsclass.txt  //To ignore the upper and lowercase while searching

grep -c John devopsclass.txt   //To print how many times {count} given keyword present in file

grep -w John devopsclass.txt   //To search for exact match of given keyword in a file

grep -n John devopsclass.txt   //To print the line no. of matches of given keyword in a file
```

Disploying only the matched pattern: By default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the -o option.

**grep -o** devops Disploying only the matched pattern: By default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the **-o** option.

```jsx
error_file=`cat /var/log/messages`
matched_error=`grep -i error /var/log/messages`
echo $matched_error
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]
then
    echo "found error in OS logs: $matched_error "
else
    echo "no error in message logs "
fi
```
