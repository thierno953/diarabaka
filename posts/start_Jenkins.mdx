**Jenkins** is used to continuously build and test our software projects, making it easier for developers to incorporate changes into the project and for users to get a new release more easily. It also allows us to continuously deliver our software by integrating with a variety of test and deployment technologies.

### Configure Jenkins on Linux

```jsx
#Install Java OpenJDK
sudo yum -y install epel-release
sudo yum -y install java-11-openjdk

#Make sure Java is installed by running:
java -version

#Start by importing the repository key from Jenkins:
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key

#After importing the key, add the repository to the system:
sudo yum -y install wget
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

#Next, install the Jenkins package using yum:
sudo yum -y install jenkins

#You can now start the Jenkins service using:
sudo systemctl start jenkins

#A health check should return the working state
systemctl status jenkins
```

Enable port 8080/tcp on the firewall:

```jsx
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

The service must be listening on port 8080

```jsx
sudo ss -tunelp | grep 8080
```

Access the URL to access the web installation wizard.

```jsx
http://[serverip_or_hostname]:8080
```

When vousaccessing a new Jenkins instance for the first time, you are prompted to unlock it using an automatically generated password.

Copy-paste the auto-generated alphanumeric password into the Administrator Password field and click Continue.
