### What is variable in shell scripting ?

a) A shell variable is a character string in shell that stores some value. It could be an integer, filename, string or some shell command itself. Basically, it is a pointer to the actual data stored in memory.

b) Assigning a value to a variable: To assign a value to a variable, use the assignment operator **(=)**. For example, to assign the value **devops** to a variable named **name**, the syntax would be: **name="devops"**.

c) Using a variable in a command: To use a variable in a command, prefix the variable name with a dollar sign **($)**. For example, to print the value of the **name** variable, the syntax would be: **echo $name**.

d) Performing operations on variables: We can perform operations on variables, such as arithmetic operations on numerical variables, or concatenation of strings. For example, to add the values of two numerical variables **a** and **b**, the syntax would be: **c=$((a + b))**.

e) Using specific variables: Shell scripting also supports special variables such as $0, which refers to the name of the script, **$1, $2, $3** etc which refer to the first, second, third, etc command-line arguments passed to the script and **$#\*\*, which gives the number of command-line arguments passed to the script.

**example**

```jsx
var="devopsclass"

echo $var
```

### What is if-else in shell scripting ?

**If-Else in shell scripting**

In Shell Scripting, the **if-else** statement is used to make decisions based on the values of variables or the results of commands. The basic syntax of an **if-else** statement is as follows:

```jsx
if [ condition ]; then
   commands
else
   commands
if
```

**If-Else Continued...**

It's also possible to use elif(else if) statement which allows you to chain several conditions together. The syntax for using elif is:

```jsx
if [ condition1 ]; then
   commands
elif [ condition2 ]; then
   commands
else
   commands
if
```

**example**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "script to install git "
echo "Installation started"
if [ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ];
then
        echo "this is linux box,installing git"
        yum install git -y
elif [ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ];
then
        echo "this is not linux box"
        echo "this is Macos"
        brew install git
else
        echo "not installing"
fi
```
