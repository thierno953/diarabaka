They are also known as positional parameters in Linux.

We use command-line arguments to demote the position in memnory where the command and it's associated parameters are stored. Understanding the command-line arguments is essential for people who are learning shell scripting.

**example1:**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is my shell script name: $0 "
echo "This is first argument passed to my script: $1"
echo "This is second argument passed to my script: $2"
echo "This is third argument passed to my script: $3"
if [ $# -eq 0 ];
then
   echo "Please pass atleast 1 argument "
else
   echo "Arguments passed is: $#"
fi
```

```js
chmod +x file1.sh

.file1.sh name age country
```

**example2:**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
#Author: Thierno
#Installing multiple packages

if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]
then
  echo "Usage: please provide software names as command line arguments"
  exit 1
fi

if [[ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]]
then
  echo "Please run from root user or with sudo privilage"
  exit 2
fi

for softwares in $@
do
  if which $softwares &> /dev/null
  then
     echo "Already $softwares is installed"
  else
     echo "Installing $softwares ......"
     yum install $softwares -y &> /dev/null
     if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]
     then
       echo "Successfully installed $softwares packages"
     else
       echo "Unable to install  $softwares"
     fi
  fi

done
```

```js
chmod +x file2.sh

.file2.sh git httpd docker
```
