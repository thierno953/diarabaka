Like any other programming language, Shell-Scripting also supports functions. Functions are popular for the following reason:

a) - Help to reuse a piece of code.

b) - Improvise the readability of the program.

c) - Make the program modular.

d) - Make maintenace easier.

A function is a block of code that is reusable and performs certain operations.

Function concept reduces the code length.

Two ways to define a function.

```jsx
function funtion_name {
    commands/statements
}

funtion_name() {
    commands/statements
}
```

### Case statement in shell scripting

You can use multiple **if..elif** statements to perform a multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution, especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single variable.

Shell support **case--esac** statement which handles exactly this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated "if..elif" statements.

### Case statement continued...

```jsx
case word in
   pattern1)
      Statement(s) to be exacuted if pattern1 matches
      ;;
   pattern2)
      Statement(s) to be exacuted if pattern2 matches
      ;;
   pattern3)
      Statement(s) to be exacuted if pattern3 matches
      ;;
   *)
      Default condition to be executed
      ;;
esac
```


**example1:**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "--------welcome to calculator---"
echo "--------------------------------"
echo -e "[a]addition\n[b]Subtraction\n[c]Multiplication\n[d]Division\n"
read -p "Enter your choice: " choice
case $choice in
   [aA])
        read -p "Enter first number: " num1
        read -p "Enter second number: " num2
        result=$((num1+num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
   [bB])
        read -p "Enter first number: " num1
        read -p "Enter second number: " num2
        result=$((num1-num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
   [cC])
        read -p "Enter first number: " num1
        read -p "Enter second number: " num2
        result=$((num1*num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
   [dB])
        read -p "Enter first number: " num1
        read -p "Enter second number: " num2
        result=$((num1/num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
    *)
       echo "Wrong choice"
       ;;
esac
``` 

**example2:**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is function test"
disk_utilization()
{
   disk=`df -h`
   echo "disk utilization is : $disk"
}
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]];
then
   echo "this is disk usage report"
   disk_utilization
else
   echo "disk has some issue "
fi
```

**example3:**

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "--------welcome to calculator---"
echo "--------------------------------"
read_input()
{
        read -p "Enter first number: " num1
        read -p "Enter second number: " num2
}
echo -e "[a]addition\n[b]Subtraction\n[c]Multiplication\n[d]Division\n"
read -p "Enter your choice: " choice
case $choice in
   [aA])
        read_input
        result=$((num1+num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
   [bB])
        read_input
        result=$((num1-num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
   [cC])
        read_input
        result=$((num1*num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
   [dB])
        read_input
        result=$((num1/num2))
        echo "The result for your choice is: $result"
        ;;
    *)
       echo "Wrong choice"
       ;;
esac
```
