### What is sed?

- Sed command performs lot of functions like :

**Viewing file contents**

**Searching**

**Find and Replace**

**Insertion and deletion**

Sed also supports regular expressions which allows it perform complex pattern matching.

#### Avantages of sed over vi/vim editor:

Sed can perform any operations on file without opening the file.

Sed syntax:

```jsx
Sed [options] commands [file-to-work-with-sed]
```

filename.txt

```jsx
1  Test
2  this is just for test command
3  Devops is amazing
4  Linux is mandatory for devops engineers
5  How wonderful our life will be if we get dream job
6  I love devops
7  Terraform is good tool
8  Sed is amazing
9  I know programming
```

#### Viewing file contents using sed command

```jsx
sed '' filename.txt

sed 'p' filename.txt //It will print output twice.

sed -n 'p' filename.txt //This will ignore 2 times print.

sed -n '$p' filename.txt //This will print last line.

sed -n '5,10p' filename.txt //It will print 3rd to 10th line.

sed '10d' filename.txt //Only while displaying Delete 10th line number.

sed -i '2,10d' filename.txt //Delete in original file itself.

sed -i.back '2,10d' filename.txt //This will take backup before delete.
```

#### Find and Replace with sed

```jsx
sed 's/root/devops' filename.txt //Substitute root with devops 1st word occurrence with new word

sed 's/root/devops/g' filename.txt //Substitute root with devops globally in whole file

sed -i.back 's/root/devops/g' filename.txt //Changed original file itself

sed '/search/s/old/new/g' filename.txt //Replaces the old word with new word if that new line consists of search word.
```

**example:**

```jsx
sed 's/root/devops/' /etc/passwd

sed 's/root/devops/g' /etc/passwd

sed 's/root/devops/' /etc/passwd
```

#### Insertion and deletion with sed command

```jsx
Insert a new line (sed 'line_numberi' filename)

Sed -i (1i s_no name) filename

Sed -i '1a ---------------' filename.txt

```
