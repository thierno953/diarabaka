CI/CD is a solution to the problems that integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (**AKA "integration hell"**).

**exemple:**

```jsx
| Continuous Integration  | Continuous Delivery   | Continuous Deployement  |
| :---                    |    :----:             |          ---:           |
| Build                   | Automatically Release | Automatically Deploy    |
| Test                    |   To                  |   To                    |
| Merge                   | Repository            | Production              |
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes to the main branch as often as possible. Developer changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration issues that can arise when you wait until release day to merge changes into the release branch.

Continuous integration emphasizes automating testing to verify that the application isn't broken each time new commits are pushed into the master branch.

#### What you need 👍

> 1 - Your team will need to write automated tests for every new feature, improvement, or bug fix.
>
> 2 - You need a continuous integration server that can monitor the main repository and run the tests automatically for each new commit pushed.
>
> 3 - Developers should merge their changes as often as possible, at least once a day.

#### what you earn 👍

> 1 - Fewer bugs are sent to production because regressions are caught early by automated testing.
>
> 2 - Building the release is easy as all integration issues have been resolved early.
>
> 3 - Less context switching as developers are alerted as soon as they break the build and can work on fixing it before moving on to another task.
>
> 4 - Testing costs are dramatically reduced, your CI server can run hundreds of tests in seconds.
>
> 5 - Your team spends less time testing and can focus on meaningful quality culture improvements.

### Continuous deployment (CD)

Continuous deployment goes beyond continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes through all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There is no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change from being deployed to production.

Continuous deployment is a great way to speed up the feedback loop with your customers and relieve the team because there's no more "release day". Developers can focus on building software and see their work go live within minutes of finishing working on it.

### Continuous delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a test and/or production environment after the build stage.

This means that in addition to automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application at any time with the click of a button.

#### What you need 👍

> 1 - You need a solid foundation in continuous integration and your test should sufficiently cover your codebase.
>
> 2 - Deployments must be automated. The trigger is still manual, but once a deployment is initiated, no human intervention should be required.
>
> 3 - Your team will most likely need to adopt feature flags so that incomplete features don't affect customers in production.

#### what you earn 👍

> 1 - Deployment software complexity removed. Your team no longer needs to spend days preparing a release.
>
> 2 - You can post more often, speeding up the feedback loop with your customers.
>
> 3 - There is much less decision pressure for small changes, which encourages faster iteration.

### Plugins in Jenkins

Plugins are the primary way to enhance the functionality of a Jenkins environment to meet specific organizational or user needs. There are over a thousand different plugins that can be installed on a Jenkins controller and for integrating various build tools, cloud providers, analytics tools, and more.
