Measuring the system load or load average is typical to understand how our servers are working; if overload, we need to optimize or kill the processes that are consuming high resource amounts, or give other resources for balancing the workload.

Two essential terms in each Unix-like systems:

**Load average:** Load average is an average system load measured on a provided time of 15, 5, and 1 minute.

**CPU load/System load:** CPU load/System load is a calculation of CPU under or over utilization in the Linux system; the processes that are in waiting state or being run via the CPU.

```jsx
#!/bin/bash
echo "CPU Load average value check"
load=`top -bn1 | grep load | awk '{printf "%.2f%%\t\t\n", $(NF-2)}' | cut -d '%' -f1`
echo $load
if [[ ${load%.*} > 1 ]];
then
    echo "cpu load is very high: $load"
else
    echo "Load is normal"
fi
```
