# What is PromQL ?

PromQL is a query language for Prometheus monitoring system. It is designed for building powerful yet simple queries for graphs, alert or derived time series.

## Data Types

PromQLuses for data types

- **Scalar** : The expressions resulting in a single constant numeric floating number is scalar. **e.g, 11.99**

- **Range vector** : These vector have a list of values corresponding to each timestamp in the time series.

- **Instant vector** : These vector have a single value corresponding to each timestamp in the time series.

- **String** The expressions whose output is a string literal is a part of this category. It is current unused in Prometheus. **eg, welcome**

**Example**

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total;

prometheus_http_requests_total[1m];
```

## Prometheus Selectors

Selectors help users to narrow down the results of an expression. For example **prometheus_http_requests_total{handler="/alerts"}** is a selector. Which will result in an all time-series having the metric name **prometheus_http_request_total** and label handler with value/alerts.

```jsx
process_cpu_seconds_total

process_cpu_seconds_total{job="Node Exporter"}
```

## Types of Matchers

**Equality matcher(=)** : Select labels that are exactly equal to the provided string.

```jsx
process_cpu_seconds_total{job!="Node Exporter"}
```

- **Negative Equality matcher(!=)**: Select labels that are not equal to the provided string.

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api.*"}
```

- **Regular expression matcher(=~)**: Select labels that regex-match the provided string.

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api.*"}
```

- **Negative Regular expression matcher(!~)**: Select labels that do not regex-match the provided string.

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total{handler!~"/api.*"}
```

# Binary Operators

Binary Operators are the operators that take two operands and performs the specified calculations on them.

Prometheus is query language supports basic logical and arithmetic operators. For operations between two instant vectors, the matching behavior can be modified.

### Binary Operators

There are three types of Binary Operators

```jsx
Arithmetic binary operators

Comparison binary operators

Logical/set binary operators
```

## Arithmetic binary operators

Arithmetic operators are the symbols that represent arithmetic math operations.

```js 
+ (addition)

- (subtraction)

\ (multiplication)

/ (division)

% (modulo)

^ (power/exponentiation)
```

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total * 2;
```

### Comparison binary operators

Comparison operators is a mathematical symbols which is used for comparison.

```jsx
== (equal)

!= (not-equal)

> (greater-than)

< (less-than)

>= (greater-or-equal)

<= (less-or-equal)
```

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total > 12;

node_cpu_seconds_total == 2.19;
```

### Logical/set binary operators

The logicial operators are used to combine simple relational expression into more complex expression.

```jsx
and (intersection)

or (union)

unless (complement)
```

vector 1 **and** vector 2, vector 1 **or** vector 2, vector 1 **unless** vector 2

```jsx
prometheus_http_requests_total or node_cpu_seconds_total
```

### Aggregation Operators

Aggregation Operators calculate mathematical values over a time range.

```jsx
sum (calculate sum over dimensions)

min (select minimum over dimensions)

max (select maximum over dimensions)

avg (calculate the average over dimensions)

group (all values in the resulting vector are 1)

stddev (calculate population standard deviation over dimensions)

stdvar (calculate population standard variance over dimensions)

count (count number of elements in the vector)

count_values (count number of elements with the same value)

bottomk (smallest k elements by sample value)

topk (largest k elements by sample value)
```

```jsx
sum(prometheus_http_requests_total) by (code)

topk(3, sum(prometheus_http_requests_total) by (code))

max(node_cpu_seconds_total)
```

**Functions Changes - deriv(), predict_linear**

```jsx
changes(node_cpu_seconds_total{job="Node_Exporter"}[1m])

deriv(process_resident_memory_bytes{job="prometheus"}[1h])

predict_linear(node_memory_MemFree_bytes{job="Node_Exporter"}[1h],2*60*60)/1024/1024
```
