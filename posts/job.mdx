description: A Jenkins job is a sequential set of tasks that a user defines. For example, a job can fetch source code from version control, compile the code, run unit tests, and more.

Note that in Jenkins, the term **job** is synonymous with **project**. In addition, the number of job types depends on the plugins that you have installed. For example, a Maven project/job is only available if you installed the Maven plugins.

### Jenkins job types

**Freestyle project:**

This task type is the default project type and is the most flexible to configure.

**Pipeline:**

A pipeline is a way of defining your entire build process using code in the form of a Jenkinsfile.

### job pipeline

```jsx
pipeline {
   agent any

   stages {
      stage('Hello') {
         steps {
            echo 'Hello World'
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### Multi-Branch Pipeline

A multi-branch pipeline is an extension of a Pipeline Job. However, it has a way of automatically creating Jenkins pipelines based on source control branches. Jenkins can then automatically discover new branches in the source control, and it can also automatically create a pipeline for that branch.

### How to chain jobs
